/**
 * Fixed-capacity particle pool — the shower of light a cleared klax throws.
 *
 * WHY STREAKS, NOT DOTS. The X3 waveguide is additive: black is transparent
 * and only lit pixels exist, so a particle is a moving scrap of light with
 * nothing behind it. A single-pixel dot at 60fps on a see-through display
 * reads as a flicker — the eye has no background to anchor it against and
 * the sample is too small to survive the optics. So every particle draws as
 * a short segment laid along its OWN velocity: head at the current position,
 * tail trailing back along the direction of travel, length proportional to
 * speed (clamped). Fast sparks stretch into hot dashes, slow ones shrink to
 * sparks, and the whole burst reads as motion instead of noise. It is the
 * same trick a long camera exposure plays on a firework, and it costs one
 * batch.line per particle.
 *
 * WHY A POOL. update()/draw() run on the GL thread every frame. A single
 * allocation in that path invites the collector, and on this hardware a GC
 * pause is not an abstraction — it is a hitch the wearer feels as the world
 * stuttering on their face (see SfxMixer for the audio-stack version of the
 * same lesson). So: parallel FloatArrays sized once at construction, a ring
 * cursor for recycling, and not one object created after the constructor
 * returns. `count` bigger than the pool is legal and harmless; the oldest
 * survivors are simply overwritten. The pool NEVER grows.
 *
 * Lengths below are in the coordinate space the game hands NeonBatch. The
 * defaults are tuned for the ~±10 x ±6 world the game logic works in; if a
 * caller drives the batch in plane-local meters instead, call
 * [scaleLengths] once at init rather than editing this file.
